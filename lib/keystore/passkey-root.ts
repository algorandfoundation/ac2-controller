 * Both roots this wallet holds are records of type `hd-root-key`, and the only
 * thing telling them apart is `metadata.scheme`:
 *
 * - `bip32-ed25519` — the extended account root, parent of every `hd-derived-ed25519`
 *   account/identity key. It was also the passkey parent for as long as it was
 *   the only root a wallet exposed.
 * - `pbkdf2-p256` (this one) — the root the deterministic-P256 contract is
 *   actually defined against; `deriveDomainKey` in `keystore-core` refuses any
 *   other parent.
 *
 * So a lookup by `type` alone returns whichever root happens to come first,
 * which is exactly how passkeys ended up hanging off the account root.
